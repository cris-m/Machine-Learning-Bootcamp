    "    Accuracy in classification problems is the number of correct prediction made by the model divided by the total number of predictions. It is not a good choice with unbalanced classes. Imagin we had 99 images of dogs and 1 image of cat. If our model was simply a line that always prediction dog would get 99% accuracy.\n",
